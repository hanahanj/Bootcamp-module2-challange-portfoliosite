    <p>
      Jonathan Hanahan is a multifaceted researcher, critical designer, and educator with a complex relationship with technology—simultaneously fascinated and apprehensive. His innovative approach involves harnessing technology to scrutinize its own impact. Through speculative exploration, he delves into the tangible, cultural, and societal
      consequences of digital experiences and technology's role in shaping our daily existence. Hanahan specializes in crafting Thick Interfaces—media and experiences that disrupt the familiar digital veneers, revealing the complexity beneath.
