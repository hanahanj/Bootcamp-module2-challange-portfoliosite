# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Overview

This is a built from scratch portfilio site using flexbox and responsive styling. The goal is to create a homepage to showcase work samples as they are developed through this bootcamp. Currently it has 1 live link, to challange 1 from the bootcamp, and the remainder are placeholders to be filled as projects are developed in this course.

The priorites were:
> * Show developers name, photo, and links to an about section, work section, and contact section
> * The UI Should scroll to corresponding sections when clicked 
> * Links in the work section should deploy application
> * The first application in work section should appear bigger than the rest
> * Content should adjust when window is resized or viewed on a different device
